<p>As a designer, there is nothing more frustrating then opening up another designers working files and discovering that in the process of creating an effect they destroyed the original image.  And now you, the person charged with making an edit to that image, has to recreate the entire thing from scratch.  There are a lot of different ways to do non destructive editing, so today I thought I would show example of one of the easiest and most useful ones that I have found, the clipping mask.  Clipping masks are a super easy way that you as a designer can crop photos in Photoshop without actually deleting any portion of the photo.  Here is how it works:</p>

<p>Step 1:  Open Photoshop and create a new document.  For this example I've opened up an 1140 grid template.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/nd-editing/step-1.jpg" width="800"></p>

<p>Step 2:  Select the Shape Tool, and draw the shape that you would like your image to encompass.  For this example I'm going to draw a long thin rectangle.  I use this shape quite a bit when creating image banners or carousels, which I think we all know clients love no matter what we tell them.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/nd-editing/step-2-1.jpg" width="800">
<img class="center" src="/images/nd-editing/step-2-2.jpg" width="800"></p>

<p>Step 3:  Go ahead and bring in your image.  The way that I like to place an image in Photoshop is to open the file menu and then select place.  I then use the browser to find the image I want to place and then select place.  The reason I like to do it this way rather than opening the image and just dragging it over to my new Photoshop document is, when you place it not only does it automatically name the layer whatever the file name is (which is nice for organizing your document) it also brings it in as a smart object.  I'm not going to go into all of the benefits of smart objects on this post, but know that smart objects give you a lot of editing flexibility that can really make your life easier once you know how to properly use them.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/nd-editing/step-3.jpg" width="800"></p>

<p>Step 4:  Okay, now that we have our custom shape drawn and our image the next thing we need to do is check our layer palette and make sure that the image is stacked above the shape layer.  This should have happened automatically if you followed the steps I outlined, but it never hurts to double check.  Once you have confirmed that the image layer is above the shape layer go ahead and right click (control-click) on your image layer in the layer palette.  This will bring up a menu of options.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/nd-editing/step-4.jpg" width="800"></p>

<p>Step 5: Once the menu is up, select Create Clipping Mask from the list of options.  Here's what your image should look like.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/nd-editing/step-5.jpg" width="800"></p>

<p>Now you are free to scale and crop the image however you see fit without having to destroy the original image layer.  If you find that the image box is not the correct size, just adjust your clipping mask layer.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you out.  Feel free to share any other tips or tricks you might know in the comments section.</p>

<h3>How to Avoid Pitfalls When Creating Custom Illustrations for Clients.</h3>

<p>One of the first things I learned after I graduated from college is as a designer you should never become emotionally attached to your designs.  It's a lesson that has served me well during my career.  Don't get me wrong, when a client really likes something I have done, I'm happy and I feel good about my work, but I don't jump up on my chair and crown myself God of design, or Lord of the Office.  On the flip side if a client doesn't like what I have done, I'm not happy, but I don't go into the bathroom and cry about it.  It's all part of the business and I accept that.  Unfortunately, this principle was recently put to the test when I was assigned to create three custom illustrations for a clients website.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>With Great Knowledge Comes Great Responsibility</h3>

<p>It seemed like a pretty straight forward project.  The client wanted a single page site that would provide information to potential customers.  The only thing that was different was he thought it would be cool to have three custom banners rotating rather than photography.  Great, I like to do illustrations and stock photography is awful so should be fun.  And that's where I made my first mistake.  I didn't view this as a normal project, so I didn't follow our normal process for approval.</p>

<h3>What I did do?</h3>

<p>The first thing I did was scour the internet for inspiration.  I went through all of my normal design resources, along with some new ones, since this was the first time I was doing illustrations for a client.  I found several concepts that I really liked and that I thought would fit well with the tag lines he had provided.  I showed the concepts to my creative director and to our senior designer.  Both of them were super excited and thought they would be great for this project.  The next thing I did was figure out what type of illustration style I would use.  Since I can really only illustrate in a couple of different styles, this wasn't that hard.  Once I had those two things figured out, then I developed a color palette that I could use for both the illustrations and the client's site.  Then it was off to the races.   I spent the next three days fleshing out my three illustrations.   Once I had put the finishing touches on them I submitted them to the project lead who then showed them to client.  As far as I was concerned this was a mere formality.  Of course the client was going to love them.  Just look at these illustrations, who wouldn't want these on their brand new site.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/watering.jpg" width="700">
<img class="center" src="/images/fishing.jpg" width="700"></p>

<p>Well as it goes, it turns out the client did not want these on his site.  What I found out, which I should have found out right from the beginning, is the client didn't like my concepts.  He loved the illustration quality and the style, but he wasn't thrilled about the themes.  He felt they were too playful and did not convey the professionalism he wanted his site to have.  He especially was not thrilled that their were people in the illustrations, something he had not previously mentioned, but would have come up had I submitted my concepts before actually completing the illustrations.  Well, needless to say, I was pretty upset.  I had spent a ton of time on these illustrations, and I didn't agree with his assessment.  I didn't understand how anyone could not like my illustrations, and that's when I realized that I had broken my rule.  I had become emotionally attached to this project and made it about me instead of about my client.  I didn't submit my concepts to him, because it wasn't about him, it was about me.  Once I realized this I immediately calmed down, and set up an appointment to meet with the client.</p>

<h3>What I should have done</h3>

<p>The client and I met, we discussed in more detail the type of theme he wanted for the illustrations.  I pitched ideas and gave him rough sketches right there in the meeting.  In talking it out, we decided that he would be best served to have only one banner rather than three.  Had we done that in the beginning I would have saved myself at least three full days of illustrating.  I had him approve sign off on the concept he liked best and then I did a more detailed drawing that was still a little rough around the edges, but was good enough to give him an idea of what the final piece would look like.  Once he signed off on that, I fleshed out the rest of the illustration and sent it off to him for approval.  Once he saw the finalized illustration, he approved it and I was able to then design the mockup for his site and the print based mailer that would accompany it.  Both the site and the mailer were approved with minimal changes.  Here is the illustration the client ended up approving.  Of the four illustrations I did, it was my least favorite, but I guess that is the point of this whole story.</p>

<h3>What did I learn?</h3>

<p>Illustrations are such a personal form of artwork.  Every artist has their own style and technique.  Because of that I think we forget that when we are working for a client the artwork can't just speak to us, it has to speak to them as well.  If I had just followed the same process that I normally do for a design, I would have saved both myself and my company a ton of time, not to mention I wouldn't have gotten rainy face over the client rejecting my art.</p>
