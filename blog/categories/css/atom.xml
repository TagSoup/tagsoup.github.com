<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rwaldron">@rwaldron</a> showed off his node/arduino goodies. He's starting building on top of a previously existing library, and extending the hell out of it. I can't wait to start messing with this one:<a href="https://github.com/rwldrn/duino">duino</a>. We also have the video recording from our Skype call. The video capture is a bit choppy, but the audio is yummy. So if you don't like the choppy, just listen. It's well worth it.</p>

<p>Special shout outs to Taco, Alli, BumbleBee and "them apples".</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/divya">@divya</a> was next up and she covered a bunch of topics. From <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 boilerplate</a>, <a href="http://nimbu.in/fronteers/#slide1">the new developer workflow</a>, build scripts, <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/11/firefox-4-font-feature-support/">webfonts</a>, css preprocessors, hawt pink and more. The fun new toy I will be playing with after hearing @divya talk about... css <a href="http://asset2.cbsistatic.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2011/05/09/Adobe-CSS-Arches-wrap.jpg">Exclusions</a>. mmmmhmmmmm</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ky644CD6Gvk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>After the video chats, the group got into a discussion this <a href="http://piratepad.net/VxKrMKu39A">piratepad list</a>. Looks like we have found some spots for the rumgr folks! I will be writing a blog post explaining why the 30 Day Challenge never finished.</p>

<p>!conf has the last JS ticket to give away. How do you win? Well, come to the conference dressed in your best cowboy/cowgirl outfit. The best dressed gets it. Why did we decide to go this route? Well, everyone can easily participate, it adds a ton of fun to the conference, and who doesn't love sharply dressed cowfolk? <a href="http://jsconfus2012.eventbrite.com/">JSConf party tickets</a> have gone on sale now. I hear the parties are amazing. Come hang with us.</p>

<p>!conf still needs some volunteers. If you're interested, send @PhxTagSoup or @notconf a msg. Please consider it if you have spare time. It's going to be a fun one.</p>

<p>TagSoup needs help too. Whether it's design, writing, code, hairstyling etc... we can use your help. I will leave it at that.</p>

<p>Thanks so much to everyone that came. NACHOS!!!</p>

    <div class="corners">
        <div class="shadow">
            <img src="http://www.placekitten.com/256/300" alt="meow" />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Here is the end result of this experiment <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tonyjcamp/rATuB/18/" target="_new">Kitty Corners</a>. Continue on to read my blabber.</p>

<p>As developers, we're constantly trying to "level-up". Becoming a better developer is all about writing code. A goofy, but fun exercise I do from time to time involves browsing <a href="http://www.dribbble.com" target="_new"/>dribbble</a>. I browse some of the great pieces of art on there and try to emulate it with CSS. I came across a piece by <a href="http://dribbble.com/larrychen" target="_new">Larry Chen</a> called <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/118282-Photo-Border-Style" target="_new">Photo Border Style</a>. I figured I could whip up that border treatment pretty easily.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I knew <a href="http://css-tricks.com/pseudo-element-roundup/" target="_new">CSS pseudo elements</a> would be necessary. I had seen a couple of blog posts showing how to manipulate css borders to make triangles <a href="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/pure-css-shapes-triangles-delicious-logo-and-hearts/" target="_new">(like this one)</a>. I figured I would just toss a :before and :after pseudo element on the image and get a nice start on my border treatment.</p>

<h3><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tonyjcamp/rATuB/" target="_new">Snag #1</a></h3>

<p>Now, I messed with that pseudo element for a while and nothing was working. I thought I was going crazy. I wasn't, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6949148/css-after-not-adding-content-to-certain-elements/6949190#6949190" target="_blank">pseudo elements can't be used on image tags</a>?!? Why? :before and :after only work with non-replaced elements. A replaced element is any element whose appearance and dimensions are defined by an external resource. So, yup, an img falls under this category. So my first idea is a no go... moving on.</p>

<p>Once I found out I couldn't use the pseudo elements on the img tags, I plopped in some span tags and added my pseudo elements. I had a white triangle overlapping the top left and bottom right corners. I was getting somewhere.</p>

<h3><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tonyjcamp/5J2LZ/1/" target="_new">Level +1</a></h3>

<p>The next task is getting the hairline drop shadows on the corner treatments. After thinking a bit, I had an easy solution. I would just add another triangle underneath it. This would be a tad bigger and blacker, but with some opacity. It turned out, the idea worked nicely.</p>

<h3><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tonyjcamp/rATuB/2/" target="_new">Level +1</a></h3>

<p>As you can see, the CSS is pretty messy. Lots of repetition, no inheritance, it was mostly just idea barf. Which is ok, but not final. More importantly, the damn thing doesn't scale...</p>

<h3><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tonyjcamp/x9knt/" target="_new">Snag #2 - Y U NO SCALE BRO?</a></h3>

<p>Adding the image to scale and keep the border treatment wasn't too bad, just change the display property on the container div
<code>
display: inline-block;
</code></p>

<p>Now comes the markup and the CSS clean up. Here's where I ended up.</p>

<h3><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tonyjcamp/rATuB/18/" target="_new">Level +1 - FINISH</a></h3>

<p>I changed a few elements around. I added a div to center the image in the fiddle (totally not needed). Had one div with the psuedo elements for the top left and bottom right corner treatment, as well as a "shadow" element for each. In the end, 2 divs, and an img tag did the trick.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Here's a screen shot of my issue. Notice the sub nav being cut off!</h4>

<div class="clearfix">
<a href="http://TagSoup.github.com/images/nav-barf.jpg" target="_new"><img class="left" src="/images/nav-barf.jpg" width="300" height="197" title="Why does" alt="IE Hate Developers?"></a>
</div>


<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tonyjcamp/eNr2M/">TL;DR - Gimmie Solution</a></p>

<p>Don't you hate it when you find yourself debugging some weird CSS issue knowing full well you've solved the same exact problem in the past? I catch myself doing this all the time. I'm being a bit hard on myself. It's not like I run into the same bug, project after project, failing to learn the solution. It's more like... "Shit I remember this bug, it happened to me 9 months ago, I can't remember how I fixed it back then. KKKKAAAAHHHHNNNNNNNN".</p>

<!--more-->


<p>This just happened to me. Instead of repeating my same old pattern of "solve and forget" (devs love patterns), I decided to take some time to write about the bug and solution. Partly for you guys, but also for myself. Now I can always reference this blog post for the solution.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert, after creating the reduced use case, the issue wasn't what I originally thought it was.</p>

<h3>Situation:</h3>

<p>I have a simple horizontal navigation menu with drop down sub-menus. This menu also has a background gradient. Totally basic, "every website has it" kinda stuff.</p>

<h3>The Issue I was having:</h3>

<p>All was well in modern-browser-land, BUT, IE9 was DOM-barfing. For some reason, IE9 was giving me an effect similar to having "overflow: hidden;" on the containing nav element. Anything outside of this container (in my case, the sub-menus) were being cut off. So first thing I look for is the overflow, then the z-indexing, what the box is doing then, then, then, etc. until I start to cry QQ.</p>

<h3>Solving the issue:</h3>

<p>Chris Coyer has a great artice on <a href="http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/">creating a reduced test case</a>. Remembering the gist of it, I opened up js-fiddle and started hacking away. I was pretty sure the filter: property was being the hooker in my code. I knew it was depricated these days, but whatevs. It ended up coming down to 3 CSS properties living on the same element. Those being:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Silly filter  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">fixed</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">z-index</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">9999</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">filter</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">progid</span><span class="nd">:DXImageTransform</span><span class="nc">.Microsoft.gradient</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">startColorstr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;#cccccc&#39;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">endColorstr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;#000000&#39;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The filter BS jumped out at me right away. So I removed filter, and the content outside of the container was showing properly. The style became:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Put me in my place  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">fixed</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">z-index</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">9999</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>For fun, I then pulled out the position: fixed. The style became:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Silly filter 2  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">z-index</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">9999</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">filter</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">progid</span><span class="nd">:DXImageTransform</span><span class="nc">.Microsoft.gradient</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">startColorstr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;#cccccc&#39;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">endColorstr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;#000000&#39;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I had my gradient, and the z-indexing working! Nice! So I started blaming position: fixed and filter being together. I told all my friends about it and they were all "bro, so cool, let's shoot red bull into our vains and snort some vodka". Just for funsies, I removed the z-index but kept the position and filter on the element.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Brotastic  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">fixed</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">filter</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">progid</span><span class="nd">:DXImageTransform</span><span class="nc">.Microsoft.gradient</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">startColorstr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;#cccccc&#39;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">endColorstr</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;#000000&#39;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>IT WORKED! No z-index, but WTF! I told all my BFF's about it and they cheered. More RB, vodka and badges to be had.</p>

<p>So wanting the best of all 3 worlds, the simpliest solution I came up with was to wrap the nav bar in container element (don't care which you use), and put position: rel and z-index on the container. I kept the position: fixed and filter on the nav. Everything worked great. WIN!</p>

<p>And dudes, I learned a ton by coming up with this silly use case and writing an even sillier blog post about it. If you ever find yourself solving and issue you want to remember later, write a post! Hell, just fork this blog and write a post. I'll add it.</p>
