Hey everyone, <a href="http://twitter.com">Luke Karrys</a> here, I'm forking ur Octopress, adding my postz.

I gave a presentation at the meetup on <a href="http://tagsoup.github.com/blog/2011/10/24/new-post/">Thursday, October 27</a> titled <a href="http://lukecod.es/presentation-slides/html5-history-102711">"HTML History &amp; You (and how to keep your hair when working with it)"</a>. If you couldn't make it (or if you just didn't get enough the first time), <a href="http://lukecod.es/presentation-slides/html5-history-102711">check out the slides</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/lukekarrys/presentation-slides">fork 'em on GitHub</a>). Hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lukekarrys">GitHub</a> with questions, comments or critiques. I'd be happy to hear it all.

And since Phoenix Tag Soup is all about doing cool stuff, enter the Konami Code. I dare you.
