Oh hai!

Come on down to [Cartel Coffee][0] in Tempe, drink some coffee and write some code. We will be there tonight from 7pm until close.

If you're interested in BackBone.js, we're looking for more people to join the training class put on by Derek Bailey from [WatchMeCode][1]. Come ask me for the deets. 

See you tonight!

Tony
