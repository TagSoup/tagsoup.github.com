###Day 9 of the 30 Day Writing Challenge

The [HTML5 Boilerplate][11] project was one of the first github projects that I REALLY started to use when it first came out. Sure, there were some libraries, plugins, or whatever that I had used before the HTML5 BP, but this is the first I used on a regular basis. After watching the repo and using the code base for a while, I would try and help out the project here and there. Most time, nothing major, but hey... better than nothing:

###[Ticket 844, History of the HTML5 BP][2]

Back in October, I went to the jQuery Conference with [@rxgx][7], [@phil_renaud][8], [@lukekarrys][9], and [@richardiii][10]. There were a ton of really great talks. One of the most entertaining, was given by [@rwaldron][4] and [@ajpiano][5] about [helping with the jQuery project][6]. They made a point to ask for help with writing documentation. During that talk, I told myself I would help write "some" documentation for "something" "soon". So one day, while looking at the open issues on the HTML5BP project, I came across [ticket #844][2]. I thought I would give it a shot. [Here's the PiratePad where it all started][3].

After some discussion on pirate pad, I came up with a some questions about the project's history. Paul was nice enough to make these videos and send them to me. These vidoes are what I based the document on. Mostly put his words down in writing, and sprinkled in a little fun. I don't think anyone has ever seen these before today. Enjoy!
