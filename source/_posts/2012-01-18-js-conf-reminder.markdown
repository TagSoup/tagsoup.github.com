##Call for help
Some of the TagSoup members are setting up a shuttle service from the airport to the hotel on Sunday. We haven't set up the times we will be offering the service, so details will be planned out as soon as we have our drivers ready. We currently have about 5 drivers that have volunteered so far. We need more people. If you are interested, please let me know. There will be something special in it for you!
