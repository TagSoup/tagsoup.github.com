This video is from our November 2011 meeting. Luke was nice enough to jump on a Skype call and spend an hour with us. This was one of the first meetings where I saw a very diverse crowd. Normally we're 90% developers. This time we had designers, project managers, account managers and developers hanging out talking about the "Mobile First" ideology &#x2665; &#x2665;. I have to give a hug(e) thanks to <a href="http://www.lukew.com/" target="_new">Luke W.</a> for taking the time to talk with us. Please, take the time to add @lukew to your twitter feed (he's very active there) and head to his site which is full of crazy good articles.

Despite a few technical difficulties, this turned out all sparkles!
