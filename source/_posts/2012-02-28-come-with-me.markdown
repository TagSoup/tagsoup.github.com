It starts strong at 2:33 in, and then goes from there. 10:25 is like the chocolate river. 13:20 is the geese that lay the golden eggs. 13:55 is the Everlasting Gobstopper. I'm TRYING to see if Bret will do a talk for us, keeping fingers crossed.

[Bret Victor][0] invents tools that enable people to understand and create. He has designed experimental UI concepts at Apple, interactive data graphics for Al Gore, and musical instruments at Alesis.

This talk was given at [CUSEC 2012][1].
