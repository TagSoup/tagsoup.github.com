After a lot of feedback from friends, we decided to start holding a TagSoup meeting each week. So, starting May 31st, we will be meeting at [Cartel Coffee][0] each week. Every Thursday night, from 7pm - close, we will be at Cartel. If you want to continue to hang out after hours, Casey Moore's is next door. Take advantage. 

May 31st's meeting will be a great time to meet with your teams (from April's meeting) and hopefully wrap up your projects. I know I still have a lot of work to do.

There will be some more announcements made later this week. Hope you all enjoy this news.
